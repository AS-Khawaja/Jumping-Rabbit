# Jumping-Rabbit

Description:
Jumping Rabbit is a simple and engaging 2D game developed in x86/88 Assembly language. The player controls a rabbit that needs to jump over obstacles to earn points and survive as long as possible. This project showcases the fundamentals of low-level programming, including direct hardware interaction, memory management, and game logic implementation using assembly.

Features:
Platform: x86/88 architecture
Graphics: Text-based or simple pixel-based display
Controls: Keyboard inputs for movement
Obstacles: Randomly appearing barriers the rabbit must jump over
Score System: Points accumulate with successful jumps
Game Over Condition: Hitting an obstacle

Technologies Used:
Assembly Language (x86/88)
NASM or other x86-compatible assemblers
DOSBox (for running in modern environments, if needed)

Project Motivation:
This project was developed to explore low-level game programming using Assembly, giving insight into how direct hardware manipulation works and enhancing understanding of CPU instructions, registers, and memory.
